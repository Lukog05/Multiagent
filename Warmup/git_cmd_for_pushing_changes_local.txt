1) Later pushes on the same branch are just:

git status               # optional, see what changed
git add .                # or add specific files
git commit -m "Short message about the change"
git push -u origin goku  # first push for this branch

2) If main moves while you’re on goku, you can update your branch:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout goku
git merge main           # or rebase if you prefer

3) When you’re done with a change
    Go to GitHub → your repo → you’ll see a banner like “Compare & pull request” for branch goku.
    Create a Pull Request from goku → main.
    Review the diff, resolve any conflicts if GitHub flags them, then Merge the PR.
    Optionally delete the branch after merge to keep things tidy:
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git branch -d goku
        git push origin --delete goku
